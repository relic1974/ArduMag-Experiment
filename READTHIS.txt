Upon deployment the MAG3110 is initialized and begins taking calibration offset measurements for 90 minutes,
taking measurements every 15 seconds for one orbital period.

offset values are calculated then experiment begins.  Takes magnetometer readings every 3 minutes.

estimated time until 10kb is reached is about 18.5 orbits
